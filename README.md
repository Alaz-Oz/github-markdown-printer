# gfm-stripper
Chrome extension that strips all the excess HTML from GitHub markdown previews, leaving just the preview.

### What's it used for?
You can use it to save markdown previews as PDFs and have them look _exactly_ like how it does on GitHub. No need to download the markdown file and run it through a converter.

### Can I see it in action?

As for the results, compare the [Electron README](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/README.md) with its [PDF counterpart](https://github.com/jerry1100/gfm-stripper/raw/master/example-readme.pdf).

### How do I use it?
1. Go to any page where a GitHub markdown preview is visible.
2. Click on the gfm-stripper icon to strip away the excess HTML so that only the preview is shown.
3. Print the page as you would normally. __Note__: make sure to check "Background graphics" so everything gets rendered correctly.
