# github-markdown-printer
Chrome extension to print GitHub Flavored Markdown exactly as it appears on GitHub.

### Why?
It's easier than downloading the markdown file and running it through a converter, and it produces much better results.

### Can I see it in action?

As for the results, compare the [Electron README](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/README.md) with its [PDF counterpart](https://github.com/jerry1100/github-markdown-printer/raw/master/example-readme.pdf).

### How do I use it?
1. Go to any page where a GitHub markdown preview is visible.
2. Click on the GitHub Markdown Printer icon which will open the print dialog with a print preview.
3. Print the page as you would normally. __Note__: make sure to check "Background graphics" so everything gets rendered correctly.
