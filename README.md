2. Click on the GMP icon which will open the print dialog with a print preview.
3. Select your printer or save as PDF and print.

### Words are cut off
Try adjusting the margins. In the print preview, click "More settings" and "Margins". Adjust them until the words are not cut off anymore.

### Code blocks aren't shaded
Make sure "Background graphics" are enabled in the print preview. To check, click "More settings" in the print preview, then look for "Background graphics".
